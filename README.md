This is a very basic sample of how to *create*, *update*, *delete* and *get data* form **mongoDB** with **Node.js*

**How to use**
  -node monjadeserver.js : to start the server with data list
  - node moncreate.js : to create new data 
  - node monupdate.js : to update existed data
  - node mondelete.js : to delete specific data 

P.S You need to install a mongo service either in your machine or connect to the server elsewhere, be sure to change the **connection string** before you go.
